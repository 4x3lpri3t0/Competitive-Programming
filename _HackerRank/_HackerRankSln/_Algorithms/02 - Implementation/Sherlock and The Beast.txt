Find the largest Decent Number having N digits.

A Decent Number has the following properties:

* Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.
* The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.
* The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.
* If there are more than one such number, we pick the largest one.

Constraints
===========

1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N <= 100000

Input Format
============

The first line is an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.

The T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, detailing the number of digits in the number.

Output Format
============

Print the largest Decent Number having N digits; if no such number exists, tell Sherlock by printing -1.

Sample Input
============

4
1
3
5
11

Sample Output
============

-1
555
33333
55555533333

Explanation
============

For N = 1, there is no decent number having 1 digit (so we print 1).

For N = 3, 555 is the only possible number.
The number 5 appears three times in this number, so our count of 5's is evenly divisible by 3 (Decent Number Property 3).

For N = 5, 33333 is the only possible number.
The number 3 appears five times in this number, so our count of 3's is evenly divisible by 5 (Decent Number Property 2).

For N = 11, 55555533333 and all permutations of these digits are valid numbers;
among them, the given number is the largest one.
