Teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers.
Pupils should calculate the sum.
To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3.
Still, that isn't enough for Xenia.
She can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.

You've got the sum that was written on the board.
Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.

Input
======

The first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count.
String s contains no spaces.
It only contains digits and characters "+".
Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3.
String s is at most 100 characters long.

Output
======
