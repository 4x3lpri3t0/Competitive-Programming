Let's consider a word "too long", if its length is strictly more than 10 characters.
All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this:
* We write down the first and the last letter of a word.
* Between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n",
and "internationalization" will be spelt as "i18n".

Input
=====

* The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
* Each of the following n lines contains one word.
* All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters
* Length from 1 to 100 characters.

Output
=====

Print n lines.
The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th wordfrom the input data.
