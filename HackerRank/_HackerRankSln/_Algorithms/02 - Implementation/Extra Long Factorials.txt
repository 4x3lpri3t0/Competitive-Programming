You are given an integer N. Print the factorial of this number.

N! = N x (N - 1) x (N - 2) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1

Input
======

Input consists of a single integer N, where 1 <= N <= 100.

Output
======

Print the factorial of .

Example 
=======

For an input of 25, you would print 15511210043330985984000000.

Note: Factorials of N > 20 can't be stored even in a 64 - bit long variable.
