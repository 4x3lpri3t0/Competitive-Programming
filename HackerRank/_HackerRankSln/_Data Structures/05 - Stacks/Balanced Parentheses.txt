Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced.
A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parentheses can be paired uniquely with a closed parentheses
that occurs after the former. Also, the interval between them must be balanced.
You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.

{[()]} - This is a balanced parentheses.
{[(])} - This is not a balanced parentheses.

Input Format
============

The first line of input contains the number of test cases, T.
Each test case consists of a single line, S, the sequence of parentheses.

Constraints 
============ 

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= lens <= 1000, where lens is the length of the sequence. 
Each character of the sequence will be one of {, }, (, ), [, ].

Output Format
============

For each test case, print on a new line "YES" if the parentheses are balanced.
Otherwise, print "NO".

Sample Input
============

3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}

Sample Output
============

YES
NO
YES
